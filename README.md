# Cybersecurity-Awareness
To teach Cybersecurity Awareness to those who have less knowledge on the subject
These are a few tips anyone can do to make sure you are more secure.

1. Have a Strong Password.
2. Make sure you have multi-factor Authentication on the accounts that support it.
3. Do not click on linkes or any type of file that is sent to you thru email. Unless you have knowledge of where and who it came from.
4. Do not scan random QR codes you see in public.
5. Have an antivirus set on your devices.
6. Public Networks are not safe. Use a VPN if you need to connect to one.
7. Update your software immediately to mitigate known security risks and protect your system from potential cyber threats.


You can also make simple changes to Your Home Network to improve network security.

1. Strong Password: A complex password is your first line of defense.
2. WPA3 Encryption: The latest encryption standard for maximum security.
3. Firmware Updates: Keep your router's software up-to-date for the latest security patches.
4. Guest Network: Isolate guest devices from your main network.
5. Disable WPS: This feature can be a security risk, so turn it off.
